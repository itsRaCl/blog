What if I'm writing to impress no one but myself
What if I know that if I impress myself, I don't care if any one likes it
What if I have set the bar so high that even I can't cross it
You sent
What if setting the bar higher than what I can achieve is what has allowed me to be what I am right now
You sent
What if
You sent
What if
You sent
what if
