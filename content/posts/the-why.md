This post was made even before this website / repository was even live, this was made as a marker, to what I've decided to do. I would want this to serve as a marker/checkpoint in the journey that I've started.
The long tumultuos journey of managing my interests. The interests that hopefully will get their representation in this blog. The old and the new interests. Let's list down the burning interests that I started this blog out with.

Here they are:
- Code:

    I've liked to code ever since we were exposed to coding (only applies to indian kids {yes me being hopeful non indians will read this üòÇ}), but yeah we were introduced to HTML in around the 8th grade, one of my computer lab teachers handed me a book of the 9th / 10th standard computer text book which had Java programming.
    That's when I started to learn programming (it wasn't really too much learning, I got confused at for loops). But then I had that itch grow in me. And that itch turned from me wanting to learn programming to learning visual basic to then purusing science + math (basically STEM) in my 11th and 12th grade to then learning python and C in my first year, and then to wherever i am right now. (I'm hoping the home page explains that in detail {Hi, to anyone reading this when the home page actuall does explain WTF i'm doing right now üòÇ})
- Biking (a lot of people do know this about me, but yes I like biking {motorcyles, not cycles üö¥üèº}):

    This is also something I **think** I got exposed to during the COVID lockdown, it was [Mumbiker Nikhil](www.youtube.com/@MumbikerNikhil) that exposed me to motorcyles and motorbiking and I've been a fan ever since.
    My current favorite biker is [Deep Ranjan Sachan](www.youtube.com/@deepranjansachan)
- Writing:

    This is just something that I discovered in school. I was one of those who always used to host the morning assembly (indian school kids might relate). And that's when I started loving to write, and create stuff of my own. Writing those assembly scripts was something that I always loved to do, especially when I had to come up with it on spot.

I guess from the types of hobbies I have you can guess that I love stuff that put me under stress, and puts pressure on me. But that's me!
I work good under pressure.

This might be really short as compared to the future blogs that I'll post (hopefully!), but yes this marks the start
